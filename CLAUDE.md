## Project Overview
This is a real-time air quality dashboard for Bangkok that displays both AQI (Air Quality Index) and AQHI (Air Quality Health Index) data on an interactive map using the WAQI API and Leaflet.js. The dashboard includes Supabase integration for data persistence and accurate AQHI calculations using 3-hour moving averages.

### Lint JavaScript
```bash
npm run lint
```
Runs ESLint on all JavaScript files in the `js/` directory.

## Architecture

### Hybrid Frontend Application
This is primarily a client-side application with optional cloud database integration. It consists of:
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript modules
- Direct API calls to WAQI (World Air Quality Index) API from the browser
- Leaflet.js for interactive mapping
- Supabase integration for data persistence and AQHI calculations
- Client-side data collection for 3-hour moving averages

### Key Modules

**Configuration** (`js/config.js`):
- Contains API token for WAQI API
- Map boundaries for Bangkok area
- AQI level thresholds and color schemes
- Pollutant definitions and metadata

**Main Application** (`js/app.js`):
- `ModernAirQualityDashboard` class manages the entire application lifecycle
- Handles data fetching, display updates, and auto-refresh
- Provides analytics methods for station categorization

**API Layer** (`js/api.js`):
- Fetches air quality data from WAQI API
- Handles station details and current location data

**Map Management** (`js/map.js`, `js/markers.js`):
- Initializes Leaflet map centered on Bangkok
- Creates and manages station markers with AQI color coding
- Handles marker interactions and popups

**UI Components** (`js/ui.js`):
- Updates sidebar displays with current AQI values
- Manages loading states and error displays
- Handles station info panel

**Statistics** (`js/statistics.js`):
- Calculates and displays AQI statistics
- Shows category breakdowns and averages

**AQHI Implementation** (`js/aqhi-supabase.js`, `js/aqhi-realistic.js`):
- Implements Air Quality Health Index calculations
- Manages 3-hour moving averages for accurate AQHI values
- Handles data quality indicators and fallback estimation methods
- Integrates with Supabase for persistent data storage

**Supabase Integration** (`lib/supabase.js`):
- Database client configuration and initialization
- Automatic data collection and storage every 10 minutes
- 3-hour moving average calculations in the database
- Built-in AQHI calculation functions

### Data Flow
1. App initializes and fetches Bangkok area stations from WAQI API
2. Stations are displayed as color-coded markers on the map (AQI or AQHI mode)
3. Data is automatically stored in Supabase every 10 minutes for historical analysis
4. Sidebar shows main location data and statistics for both AQI and AQHI
5. Auto-refresh updates data every 10 minutes
6. AQHI calculations improve over time as 3-hour moving averages become available
7. User can interact with markers to see station details and toggle between AQI/AQHI modes

### API Integration

**WAQI API**:
- `/v2/map/bounds/` - Fetch stations within Bangkok boundaries
- `/feed/@{uid}/` - Get detailed station data including pollutants
- Token-based authentication required for all API calls

**Supabase Integration**:
- Automatic data persistence for historical analysis
- Real-time 3-hour moving average calculations
- Built-in AQHI calculation functions
- Cross-device data synchronization

## AQHI Implementation

### Air Quality Health Index (AQHI)
The dashboard implements Canada's Air Quality Health Index alongside the traditional AQI. Key features:

**Scientific Accuracy**:
- Uses Health Canada's official AQHI formula
- Calculates 3-hour moving averages of PM2.5, NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, and SO‚ÇÇ
- Provides health-focused risk assessment (1-10+ scale)

**Data Quality Management**:
- **Excellent** (üéØ): 3+ hours of data, 15+ readings
- **Good** (‚úÖ): 2+ hours of data, 10+ readings
- **Fair** (‚è≥): 1+ hours of data, 5+ readings
- **Limited** (üîÑ): Building data, <1 hour
- **Estimated** (üìä): Using current reading estimation

**Calculation Methods**:
1. **Current**: Using immediate readings (first visit)
2. **Estimated**: Using estimation algorithms with variability factors
3. **Client-Average**: Using collected 3-hour moving averages (most accurate)

### Supabase Data Persistence
- **Automatic Collection**: Air quality data stored every 10 minutes
- **Historical Storage**: 7-day rolling window with automatic cleanup
- **3-Hour Averages**: Real-time calculation of moving averages in database
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Data persists across browser sessions and devices

### Configuration Files
- `AQHI-Implementation.md` - Detailed technical documentation
- `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` - Database setup and configuration guide
- `supabase-schema.sql` - Database schema and functions

## Visual Development & Testing

### Design System

The project follows S-Tier SaaS design standards inspired by Stripe, Airbnb, and Linear. All UI development must adhere to:

- **Design Principles**: `/context/design-principles.md` - Comprehensive checklist for world-class UI
- **Component Library**: NextUI with custom Tailwind configuration

### Quick Visual Check

**IMMEDIATELY after implementing any front-end change:**

1. **Identify what changed** - Review the modified components/pages
2. **Navigate to affected pages** - Use `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` to visit each changed view
3. **Verify design compliance** - Compare against `/context/design-principles.md`
4. **Validate feature implementation** - Ensure the change fulfills the user's specific request
5. **Check acceptance criteria** - Review any provided context files or requirements
6. **Capture evidence** - Take full page screenshot at desktop viewport (1440px) of each changed view
7. **Check for errors** - Run `mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages` ‚ö†Ô∏è

This verification ensures changes meet design standards and user requirements.

### Comprehensive Design Review

For significant UI changes or before merging PRs, use the design review agent:

```bash
# Option 1: Use the slash command
/design-review

# Option 2: Invoke the agent directly
@agent-design-review
```

The design review agent will:

- Test all interactive states and user flows
- Verify responsiveness (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- Check accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Validate visual polish and consistency
- Test edge cases and error states
- Provide categorized feedback (Blockers/High/Medium/Nitpicks)

### Playwright MCP Integration

#### Essential Commands for UI Testing

```javascript
// Navigation & Screenshots
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate(url); // Navigate to page
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot(); // Capture visual evidence
mcp__playwright__browser_resize(
  width,
  height
); // Test responsiveness

// Interaction Testing
mcp__playwright__browser_click(element); // Test clicks
mcp__playwright__browser_type(
  element,
  text
); // Test input
mcp__playwright__browser_hover(element); // Test hover states

// Validation
mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages(); // Check for errors
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot(); // Accessibility check
mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for(
  text / element
); // Ensure loading
```

### Design Compliance Checklist
